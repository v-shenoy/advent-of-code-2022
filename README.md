# :christmas_tree:advent-of-code-2022

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). 

I decided to take this year as an opportunity to learn Rust. My goal will be to write simple, readable, and idiomatic Rust code as much as I can.
I will be restricting myself to the standard library and try to get familiar with it. 

I will also try to add basic comments explaining my approach, as well as benchmark the code.
